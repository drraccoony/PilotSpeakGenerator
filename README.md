# PilotSpeakGenerator
A phrase generation to help me talk like pilots and fit in with the crowd

This simply works by choosing random words from an `array` and piecing them together using `array_rand()`. Also uses some javascript to copy text to the users clipboard via a button press. Keeps track of usage via a flat file `totalgens.txt` via  a `intval()` function.
